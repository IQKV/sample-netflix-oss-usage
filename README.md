## üöÄ Departments and User Profile Microservices

Minimal microservices example demo - using legacy Spring Cloud / Netflix OSS Project.

The project maintains two microservices, the department service and the user profile service. Each user profile can be linked to any department.
The User Profile Service allows you to retrieve department data by calling the Department Service REST API and complete the profile data response
with department information.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technology stack

Java 21, Maven 3, Spring Boot 2.7, Spring Cloud 2021.0.3
mongo:5.0, mysql:5.7.43, zipkin-slim:2.23.

_Including utils:_ liquibase, WireMock, Mongodb & Mysql testcontainers, docker-compose._dev_.yml,
micrometer, _checkstyle_ configuration, SpotBugs, PMD etc.

This sample project specifically demonstrates the following features using the Spring Cloud ecosystem.

- Service Registry
- Centralized Configuration
- (Client Side) Load Balancing
- Circuit Breaker pattern
